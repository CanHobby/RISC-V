# RISC-V
Some commrnts and examples on RISC-V MCUs such as the CH32Vxxx family from WCH.

After some early teething problems as documented at the <a href="https://github.com/openwch/ch32v003/issues/16" target="_blank"> openwch github</a> and my <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/191172-using-ch32vxxx-risc-v-and-moun-river" target="_blank">hackaday</a>, I am happy to submit some example code.  I am using the Moun River IDE under Linux (Mint) even though I am no Eclipse expert, so my attempts at sharing projects may seem clumsy.  Any suggestion are more than welcome.

I plan to open separate repositories for each board...  CH32V003, CH32V103, <a href="https://github.com/CanHobby/CH32V203/tree/main/USB203">CH32V203</a>...
